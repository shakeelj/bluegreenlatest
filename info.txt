** Jenkins project **

Jenkins project do this:

1. Fetch terraform project from git
2. Create and provision instance (terraform)
3. Create new image from running instance (awscli)

** Terraform file **

Terraform project is here: https://github.com/btower-labz/ami-build-poc

Main file: test.tf
Deploy script: test.sh

Basically, the areas to check are:

1. provider "aws"
Provider definition. Change this acording to your environment.
Make notice, you need to change zone info in the .aws/credentials also.

2. resource "aws_key_pair" "builder"
Key pair for deploy. It's /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/jenkins_key.pub saved as value to tf

3. resource "aws_security_group" "aws_sec"
Change this according to optapp and optweb requirements.
Also put your tags here.

4. data "aws_ami" "optapp"
Base image selection. Change filters to your image names.

5. resource "aws_instance" "optapp"
Put your tags here. They may be used for latter filtering and cleanup.

6. provisioner "file"
All provision blocks are used to configure new instance. The are run once on the instance creation.
File provisioners used to copy files. Copy you wars and deploy scripts here.

7. provisioner "remote-exec"
Use this to execute scripts and commands. Deploy yout wars here.


8. output "*"
Outputs used to display filtered data later. At the moment optapp_ip and optapp_id
